# Math-Apps
This repository contains materials relevant to the Bachelor's thesis: MathApps constructions in Maple and from Maple to Möbius, written by Line Glade at DTU.

For the creation of Math Apps it is necessary to have a license for Maple.

The Math Apps Guide is a guide for creating Maple Math Apps from scratch. When you begin looking into what it takes to write a Math App from scratch, it is very difficult to find information about the complete process. By writing this guide we hope to alleviate this problem and provide some templates to make it easy to get starty. At the moment we have found the initial learning curve to be rather steep.
Alongside the Guide are four templates. These are of varying complexity and using different components.

The Bachelors project was done in collaboration with course 01237 Differential Geometry and Parametric Design at DTU. For the course we created four assignments using Math Apps. These assignments were uploaded to Möbius for online access and grading purposes. 

To get started on a Math App we recommend reading the Math Apps Guide and then changing the relevant template to create a new question. A good idea is to initially change small things, to get a feel for how the Math Apps work.

If you need additional help or have any comments, feel free to write in the Discussions tab and I will try to reply as quickly as possible.
